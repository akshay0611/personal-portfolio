I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** focused on building **scalable, AI- and cloud-driven web products** that solve real-world problems.

I work across the full lifecycle of an application — from clean, responsive frontends to robust backend systems and cloud-ready architectures. My approach prioritizes **performance, maintainability, and long-term scalability** over quick demos or short-lived prototypes.

My core stack includes **MERN and Next.js**, with hands-on experience integrating **AI/ML capabilities and automation** into real products. I also work extensively with **Google Cloud**, building cloud-native solutions designed for production environments.

I’ve been featured by **Google for Developers** for advocating clean, readable, and maintainable code — because good software is built for teams, not just machines.

Beyond writing code, I collaborate with teams, mentor developers, and focus on building systems that create **measurable impact**.
